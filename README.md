# README - W251 Homework 6

# The Project
In this project we were tasked with using BERT to tokenize sentences of various levels of toxicity. We then used these tokenized sentences to train a BERT classifier to identify levels of toxicity of a sentence. With this model we were able to provide the BERT classifier a sentence and it could tell us how toxic it was. We were also asked to do an additional step in part 8 of the homework. For this step, I chose to make the classifier train on multiple epochs.

# The Files
* BERT_classifying_toxicity.ipynb - The notebook source code for the project
* BERT_classifying_toxicity_p100.html - The html download of the p100 run
* BERT_classifying_toxicity_v100.html - The html download of the v100 run

# The Run Times
* The v100 VM was able to run BERT_classifying_toxicity.ipynb in about 2 hours and 45 minutes
* The p100 VM was able to run BERT_classifying_toxicity.ipynb in about 7 hours and 15 minutes
